# Canvas Vim-off

## Introduction

**Canvas Vim-off** is a simple plugin for Obsidian that automatically disables Vim mode and the line number display when switching to Canvas mode and re-enables them when returning to other files. This is because Vim mode does not work smoothly in Canvas mode, and the line numbers take up too much space when editing very small nodes in the Canvas.

## Installation
1. Download the plugin files.
2. Copy the downloaded files to your Obsidian plugin folder (`.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-canvas-vim-off`).
3. Enable the plugin in the Obsidian settings.

## Usage
Once the plugin is enabled, it will automatically disable Vim mode and the line number display when you open a Canvas file, and re-enable them when you switch back to other files. No additional configuration is required.

## Features
- **Automatic Vim Mode Switching**: Automatically disables Vim mode in Canvas mode.
- **Automatic Line Number Display Switching**: Automatically disables line number display in Canvas mode.

## Configuration
No additional configuration is required. Simply enable the plugin to use it.
